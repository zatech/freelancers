## Personal blurb

I enjoy solving interesting challenges using Flutter and Dart on Android and iOS. Project sizes range from prototypes to proof of concepts, MVPs and, of course, production.

As a small business owner myself, I understand that app development can be a daunting investment, and I do my best to guide you through the process so that there's minimum time or effort wasted.

I'm happy to do a free, 30 minute video call to discuss your requirements and determine whether there's synergy between us. Ultimately, I'd like for both of us to walk away from a project feeling like we've done a good deal.

My preference is to work remotely via technologies like Slack, Skype, Zoom and Trello.

## Skill Set

Primary skills:

* Flutter  (Android and iOS)
* Dart
* Android Native
* Kotlin
* Xamarin

In the past, I've worked in JavaScript, NativeScript, Java (ME, SE, EE), Scala, Swift, Python, C, C++, PHP, HTML5, Delphi, Objective-C and some time ago, Cobol.

## Time Availability

Flexible, with a strong preference for remote work.
