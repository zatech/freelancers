# Niel Zeeman


## Personal blurb
I like technology and applying, learning and speaking about it. I have been consulting on DevOps, architecture, processes & methodologies and development practices for the last decade. I am Cape Town based and enjoy exploring the local wine farms.

## Skill Set
I have experience with a very wide range of (mostly Microsoft) platforms, languages and systems from Dynamics CRM to .Net and IoT. I am always open to learning new technology stacks and approaches and applying it to solve the problem at hand. I also enjoy tinkering with IoT and AI and have been leaned on quite often by various clients for my debugging and problem solving abilities.

## Time Availability
I try and be available when required, but is very dependent on work load at the specific point in time.  I have been complimented before on "being available when we need you".
