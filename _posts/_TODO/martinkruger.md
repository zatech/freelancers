## Personal blurb

I'm a fullstack web developer with a preference for front-end web development. I take pride in my exceptional work ethic, professionalism, resourcefulness and ability to provide solutions.

I've been using computers since I was about 6 years old, put up my first website when I was 12 years old, and have previously been a professional software developer for approximately a decade. I now focus on Web Development.

I previously studied software development at CTI and I'm currently about to finish my 2nd year in a BSc Informatics through Unisa (part-time).

I love teaching people programming/web development. I'm a web developer mentor in my free time and I have assisted other companies in developing their course material. I have also started a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Yp7xFI2SZJQxmvzwh4myA) that will focus on programming education. I plan to release a 100% free web development course in the distant future.

I ‚ù§Ô∏è the ocean and go for daily swims with my dogs üê∂ and my daughter üëß to clear the mind. My other interests include composing music (I hold a diploma in music production and music business), graphic design, programming games and snorkelling/skin-diving/scuba-diving.
