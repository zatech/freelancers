# Akshar Bhagwandin

## Personal blurb

I love coding, been doing it for the past 18 years.  I enjoy helping junior software developers and seeing them grow in the field.  Born and raised in the northern suburbs of Cape Town.  Other than coding, I am a pretty good driver and tinker around with vehicles in my free time.

## Skill Set

Below is a non-exhaustive list of languages and frameworks I have used:
* Javascript | Angular | Aurelia | React | Vue
* Java | Spring
* Python | Django
* Postgres | MySQL | MongoDB
* Docker | Kubernetes
* React Native

I am always enthusiastically learning other programming languages, frameworks and principles. 

## Time Availability

This is dependent on the project as I am quite flexible
