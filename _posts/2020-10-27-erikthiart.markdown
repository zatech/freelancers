## Personal blurb
I solve problems for a living. I am based in Bellville and I enjoy building ERP and CRM systems from scratch. I enjoy the IoT space as well, building arduino based sensors for the agriculture sector.

## Skill Set
- PHP/MySQL
- Full Stack Web Development (Bootstrap/Foundation - PHP - MariaDB/NoSQL/MySQL / REST APIs)
- Networking (Especially Mikrotik and Ubiquity devices)
- Business consultant (I enjoy consulting as much as I enjoy programming.)
- Digital Marketing (As a freelancer I often had to design and run campaigns for the companies.)

## Time Availability
Depends on the project, realistically weekends and some days during the week, depending on scope.
