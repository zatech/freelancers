## Personal blurb

I enjoy working with startup to help them grow from zero to enterprise. I have over a decade experience coding in various technologies.

As a entrepreneur I have a lot of understanding of business needs and I am here to solve real business problems, not just trying to invent cool new tech.

I'm happy to do a free, 30 minute video call to discuss your requirements and determine whether there's synergy between us. Ultimately, I'd like for both of us to walk away from a project feeling like we've done a good deal.

My preference is to work remotely via technologies like Slack, Skype, Zoom and Trello.

## Skill Set

Primary skills:

* React (Web, Android, IOS and Windows)
* GraphQL (Apollo server and client or custom thin implementation)
* NodeJS
* Angular (current version)
* Vue
* Svelte (Web, Android and IOS)
* Flutter (Android and IOS)

I have previously worked with C#.NET, Java, Python, Ruby and many other technologies but the JS ecosystem is miles ahead of other languages these days.

## Time Availability

Flexible, with a strong preference for remote work.
