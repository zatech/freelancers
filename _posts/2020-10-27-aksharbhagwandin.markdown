## Personal blurb

I love coding, been doing it for the past 18 years.  I enjoy helping junior software developers and seeing them grow in the field.  Born and raised in the northern suburbs of Cape Town.  Other than coding, I am a pretty good driver and tinker around with vehicles in my free time.

## Skill Set

Below is a non-exhaustive list of languages and frameworks I have used:
* Javascript, Angular, Aurelia, React, Vue
* Java, Spring
* Python, Django
* Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB
* Docker, Kubernetes
* React Native

I am always enthusiastically learning other programming languages, frameworks and principles. 

## Time Availability

This is dependent on the project as I am quite flexible
