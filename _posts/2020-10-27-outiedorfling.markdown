## Personal blurb
I really like helping people break down their workflow to help figure out how to simplify it.
I'm a ham radio operator and enjoy taking electronics apart with the intent to maybe one day reassemble them.

## Skill Set
I have experience with these languages/frameworks/systems, I really enjoy automating a lot of the workflow, freeing up people to focus on more important work

Main area's of expertise:
* System Architecture
* PHP
* Laravel
* MySQL, PostgreSQL
* DevOps (Docker, Packer, Ansible, Terraform, AWS, Azure, etc)
* Linux
* Reporting, understanding data

## Time Availability
Realistically I probably have around 10 hours a week max, but let me know and I'm sure we can make a plan!
