# John Roux

## Personal blurb
I'm a full-time freelancer. Apart from a keen interest in making cool stuff with code, I really enjoy getting stuck in and making things in real life too. From having an electric foundry to DIY projects at home and gardening, I'm a fan of it all!

Heavily invested in youth development and helping other humans grow and challenge themselves.
I've been involved in Scouts South Africa since 2000, from being a scout to assisting and then running and leading a Troop to being involved on the national and international level.
I volunteered as a Kids Club leader for 6 years. I'm currently serving on the Youth Leader team joined in 2014.


So in short I like making and building things, be it building up humans and guiding them through life, to building physical things to building elegant code and ops solutions.

Live and work in Cape Town, South Africa 🚀🌄
